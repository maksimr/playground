## Context7 Rule

Always use Context7 when responding to coding-related queries or when setup/configuration steps are requested. Fetch and inject latest version-specific documentation relevant to the user's technology stack directly into the context window. Do not rely solely on training data; leverage Context7 for ground-truth documentation.
